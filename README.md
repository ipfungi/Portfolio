# Portfolio 

I am a young graduate in space sciences who loves creating simulations and sharing sciences. Here are some samples of my science communication projects.

## Science writing

I have published more than 50 science communication posts on social media as a volunteer for an association (Astronomonical Society of Li√®ge). Thanks to my background in space sciences, I am able to understand and to explain unknown and complex aspects of our Universe. The topics are very diverse. Black hole processes, cosmology, history of science discoveries, extragalactic astrophysics, planetology, radio astrophysics, etc. Some of my posts are listed below with the links to their original publication in Instagram.

## Black hole raytracer

I have created a simple black-hole raytracer in Python (see the source code). It highlights the gravitational lensing effect and the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The project can be summarized in three steps. First, we have to solve the light-like geodesic equation of General Relativity for a static black hole. Second, we have to consider the inverse situation in order to drastically reduce the computation time. The observer emits photons and if a photon hits a pixel of the background image, then this pixel is turned on. By processing recursively these two steps, I was able to obtain such images.

The python code has been created with numpy, matplotlib, and PIL (source code [here](https://github.com/ipfungi/Black-hole-raytracer)).  

## Inspiral

This project concerns the animation of gravitational-wave emission during a black-hole inspiral. This two-body system evacuates gravitational energy during its orbital motion. Each black hole get closer to the other and emits spherical gravitational waves. Their intensity increases during the inspiral until the collision. The ringdown phase and the merger are not simulated since they required specific tools associated with numerical relativity.

This python simulation has been created with numpy and matplotlib (source code [here](https://github.com/ipfungi/binary-merger)). It is an OOP project.
